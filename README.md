# Autonomous-Deep-Quality-Monitoring-in-Streaming-Environments-Challenge
This challenge aims to apply knowledge learnt from artificial intelligence in a real world application.
The injection molding machine is used to produce a transparent mold where the goal of this challenge is to build a neural network classifier to monitor the quality of transparent mold. The challenge of this problem lies in its non-stationary characteristic because two machine parameters, namely holding pressure and injection speed, are varied during the process runs. 

The [dataset file](https://github.com/AlvinTang011/Autonomous-Deep-Quality-Monitoring-in-Streaming-Environments-Challenge/blob/main/OQC.mat) contains part of a real-world manufacturing dataset collected from the injection modling dataset

[Task 1](https://github.com/AlvinTang011/Autonomous-Deep-Quality-Monitoring-in-Streaming-Environments-Challenge/blob/main/Task1_ThreeLayerFeedForwardNeuralNetwork.ipynb) utilizes SGD optimzer under mini-batch update to result in the smallest testing errors

[Task 2](https://github.com/AlvinTang011/Autonomous-Deep-Quality-Monitoring-in-Streaming-Environments-Challenge/blob/main/Task2_HiddenNodes%26HiddenLayers_NetworkConfiguration.ipynb) analyzes effect of network structures based on the proposed algorithm

[Task 3](https://github.com/AlvinTang011/Autonomous-Deep-Quality-Monitoring-in-Streaming-Environments-Challenge/blob/main/Task3_LearningRate.ipynb) identifies the effects of learning rates as well as providing a plausible adaptive learning rate for the best set up

[Task 4](https://github.com/AlvinTang011/Autonomous-Deep-Quality-Monitoring-in-Streaming-Environments-Challenge/blob/main/Task4_MiniBatchSizeExperiments.ipynb) studies the effect of batch sizes on the proposed algorithm
